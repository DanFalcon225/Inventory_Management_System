# Inventory_Management_System

It is always a problem to manage a huge inventory efficiently as it requires a high accuracy of
the stock and detailed documentation of each operation. Typically Inventory management comes
across with certain issues i.e., deadstock, perishable stock, missing stock etc. The more massive
inventory is, the more severe mentioned issues become, even though a company would have a
responsible department to manage inventory it is a time and cost consumable to do so, without a
relevant system in place. Therefore, the main aim of this project is to build up a flexible and dynamic
inventory management system as web-based application which will elaborate mentioned issues, on
top of that It will enable to maintain stock accuracy and reduce business cost.

Inventory management system will not be focused on any particular industry type, as instead
it will provide a unique interface and functionality so, it will be accepting different types of entities
(type of products etc.) and perform a solid management among them. By choosing this type of
approach a potential enterprise which will be using the upcoming system will be benefited in terms of
time saving by deploying and using the system.

By working in the logistic industry over 6 years I have gained a broad experience interacting
with inventory management systems (Microsoft Dynamic NAV). The reason for choosing such a project
is the opportunity to bundle my knowledge among Computer Science and logistics by building up
relevant software. In addition, it enabled me to discover new techniques and approaches, to work
with front – end and back – end web development.
